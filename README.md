# selection_sort_algorithm

This code is a implementing selection sorting in C++.

`pseudocode`
- created a selectionsort function, pass two variable ( array, array size)
- then a for loop to iterate through all the values, store the values in a variable
- compare those values using an if condition in another for loop and substitute the smallest value to the varible you had assigned in the prevous for loop
- swap the values by creating a temp
- call the function in main function
- print the sorted array using a for loop

The `time complexity` of this algorithmn is BIG O(n^2), its not really a fast algorithm.
